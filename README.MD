Drum Kit - Project to practice the use of Event Listeners to trigger sounds.

Decomposing the program:

1. Figure out the total number of buttons.
2. Create a Loop to iterate through each button and append an event listener that triggers on "click".
3. Create  a Function that triggers an event listener when certain keys are pressed.
4. Create a Constructor Function that plays each sound separately.
5. Create a Function to "Play Sound" when certain key values are passed into it and use the Constructor Function from  before to trigger individual sounds. 
Use Switch/ Case  to create the conditions.
5. Add the "Play Sound" function inside the 'click' and 'key' functions.
6. Create Function to animate button pressed. 
    a. First it needs to add a Class to the button.
    b. Then it needs to delay it through a TimeOut function and remove that Class from the button.
